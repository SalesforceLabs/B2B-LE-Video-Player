### Picklist Value Sets

The B2B Product Video **Locales** picklist value set is used by the **Language** picklist field in the **Product Video** and **Product Video I18N** objects:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer19.PNG" height=350>

Update the **B2B Product Video Locales** picklist value set to include any additional languages and locales needed for your store users.

When adding a new **locale**, the **Value** must be the **display version** of the language (ex: Spanish), and the **API Name** must be the **locale code** (ex: es):

<img src="images/VideoPlayer21.PNG" height=300>

Click **[New]**.  Enter the **display version** of the locale in the Add Picklist Values box:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer22.PNG" height=400>

After saving the new value(s), edit them and change the **API Name** to the **location code**:

## Usage

### Add the component to your store

After installing the video player component, open your store‚Äôs community in **Experience Builder**.

Click the drop-down to the right of the **Home** page.

Expand **Product**, then click on **Product Detail**:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer24.PNG" height=500>

In the **Product Detail** page, click on the **Components** button.  Scroll the list down until you see **Custom Components**

<img src="images/VideoPlayer25.PNG" height=500>

Drag the **B2B Product Video Display** component onto the page layout

<img src="images/VideoPlayer26.PNG" height=200>

Click **Publish** to save your changes.

### Supported Configuration Options

The component comes with several properties you can use to control how the component functions.

<img src="images/VideoPlayer11.PNG" height="300">

**Current record Id:** expression used to tell the component the Id of the underlying product.  Changing this value is not recommended.

**Maximum to display:** this property is used to tell the component how many videos to display.  You can set a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5.

**Display Preference:**  You can choose Accordion or Tabset.

Be sure to click **[Publish]** to save any property changes you make.

### Create a Product Video Record

I‚Äôll add a Product Video to an existing Product.  For this existing Product record, start by clicking on the **Related** tab.

As you can see, a Product Video record has already been created for this Product.  For the new **Product Video** record I‚Äôll create, I‚Äôll set it up to display after the existing video.

<img src="images/VideoPlayer1.PNG" height="300">

Click **[New]** to create a **Product Video** record.

<img src="images/VideoPlayer2.PNG" height="500">

I‚Äôm required to select the **Language**, so I‚Äôll pick English

I‚Äôll enter a **Title**.

A **Description** is optional.  If you enter something, it will be displayed underneath the video.

The **Sequence** defaults to **500**, let‚Äôs change that to 200, so that this video will be displayed after the existing one.

For the **Start Date**, I recommend using a date prior to today.

For the **End Date**, if your video will never expire, enter a date far out into the future, like 12/31/2099.

For **Type**, choose **YouTube** for a YouTube video and enter the video Id in the **YouTube Video Id** field:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer4.PNG" height="500">

Be very careful to enter the video ID exactly.  In this example, the Id actually has a hyphen at the beginning.

I‚Äôll go ahead and **[Save]** the new record.

There are now two videos associated with the current product:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer5.PNG" height="150">

When I refresh the detail page for that product in the store, the video player component displays the videos in an accordion layout by default.  I‚Äôll show you how you can change that later.

<img src="images/VideoPlayer6.1.png" height="600">

I see that the two videos are displayed in the correct order.

The **Title** appears above the video, and the **Description** is displayed underneath.


### Changing the Display Options of the Component

The video player component comes with several configuration options that enable you to control how videos are displayed in the store.  I‚Äôll show you how to update them within **Experience Builder**.

In the store‚Äôs community, I‚Äôve opened the **Product Detail** page.  When I click on the **B2B LE Video Player** component in the layout, the configuration options are shown:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer10.PNG" height="300">

I‚Äôll change the **Maximum to display** value from 2 to 3.

I‚Äôll also change the **Display Preference** from **Accordion** to **Tabset**:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer11.PNG" height="300">

I‚Äôll publish my changes.

When I go back to the store and refresh the product detail page, the product videos now display as a series of tabs:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer12.1.png" height="500">

### Using Hosted Resources

The product video component also enables you to include videos hosted on an external server.

In order for the video to play within the store, you need to create a **CSP Trusted Site** record for the domain where the video resides.

I‚Äôve already created the record for the video I want to show in the store.  The domain is for an Amazon cloud server:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer15.PNG" height="500">

I‚Äôll go ahead and create a new **Product Video** record for this resource.

I‚Äôll select **English** as the **Language**.

I‚Äôll give it a **Title** of ‚ÄúFolgers‚Äù, and a **Description** of ‚ÄúBad Tasting Coffee?‚Äù

I‚Äôll change the **Sequence** to 300.

I‚Äôll enter a valid **Start** and **End Date**.

For the **Type**, I‚Äôll select **MP4**.

I‚Äôll enter the URL for the hosted video into the **Video URI** field:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer16.PNG" height="500">

In the store, when I refresh the product detail page, I see the hosted video is rendered and will play:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer17.PNG" height="500">

## Internationalization ##

### Adding Translations ###

The video player component fully supports internationalization.  The package you installed includes a new custom object called **Product Video I18N (a.k.a. the translation record)**.  You create a translation record from a Product Video record when you want to display the video‚Äôs **Title** and **Description** in the user‚Äôs local language.

To create a translation record, open an existing Product Video record.

Scroll down so that you can see the **Product Video I18Ns** related list:

<img src="images/VideoPlayer7.PNG" height="300">

Click **[New]**

The **Language** field is required, so I‚Äôll select **Spanish**.

**Title** is also required.  In this case, there is no Spanish translation for the video‚Äôs Title, so I‚Äôll enter the English value for that field.

For the **Description**, there is a Spanish equivalent, so I‚Äôll paste the translation into that field.

<img src="images/VideoPlayer8.PNG" height="500">

I‚Äôll go ahead and click **[Save]**.
‚ÄÉ
I‚Äôve logged into the Store as a user whose language is **Spanish**.  When I refresh the detail page for that product, I now see the **Description** displayed in Spanish:
